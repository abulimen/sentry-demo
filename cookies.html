                    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Sentry Payments ("Sentry", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website at sentrypayments.com (the "Website") and use our Pi Network payment processing and blockchain-verified review services (collectively, the "Services"). This policy details what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control their use.</p>

                    <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an online service. Website owners and service providers widely use cookies to make their websites and services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and personalize experiences. This is placeholder text for what cookies are.</p>
                    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Sentry) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. This is placeholder text for first and third party cookies.</p>

                    <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
                    <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Services to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below. This is placeholder text for how we use cookies.</p>

                    <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
                    <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Services and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Essential Website Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Services and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Placeholder text.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Services but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable. Placeholder text.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Services are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Services for you. Placeholder text.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting/Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. Placeholder text.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Your Choices Regarding Cookies</h2>
                    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by setting or amending your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information. This is placeholder text for your choices regarding cookies.</p>
                    <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.
