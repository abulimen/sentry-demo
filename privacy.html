                    <p>Sentry Payments ("Sentry", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Services. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected through our Services, including our website, APIs, and any related services, sales, marketing, or events. By using our Services, you consent to the data practices described in this policy. This is placeholder text for the introduction.</p>

                    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise contact us. The personal information we collect may include your name, email address, Pi Network username, transaction details, and other similar data. We also collect some information automatically, such as your IP address and browser type, through cookies and similar technologies. This is placeholder text for information we collect.</p>

                    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We use personal information collected via our Services for a variety of business purposes, including: to provide and operate our Services, to process your transactions, to manage your account, to communicate with you, to send you marketing and promotional communications (with your consent), to improve our Services, to ensure security, and to comply with legal obligations. This is placeholder text for how we use your information.</p>

                    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include payment processing (within the Pi Network context), data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, and customer service. We may also share your information if required by law, to protect our rights, or as part of a business transfer. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. This is placeholder text for how we share your information.</p>

                    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. This is placeholder text for data security.</p>

                    <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, update, or delete your information. You may also have the right to object to or restrict certain processing. You can usually review and change your personal information by logging into your account and visiting your account profile page. For other requests or if you have questions, please contact us. This is placeholder text for your choices and rights.</p>

                    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 18 (or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. This is placeholder text for children's privacy.</p>
                    
                    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside Pioneerland and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to Pioneerland and process it there. This is placeholder text for international data transfers.</p>

                    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
